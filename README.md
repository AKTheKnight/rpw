# ResourcePack Workbench

This project is a standalone application for manupulating Minecraft resource packs.

It's really huge, so if you want to help, you are welcome. Either via pull requests, or you can contact me to gain a "collaborator" access.

## Getting it work with eclipse / netbeans / whatever

* Checkout the repo
* Create a new project in your IDE
* Symlink the `src`, `lib` folders into your project
* Add the libs to your build path
* Try compile. If it works, you can start coding!
