## Setting up RPW for development

*If you plan to work on RPW's source code:*

The project repends on Maven, from which it takes some libraries.

First, make sure your eclipse / other IDE has Maven plugin. Then you should be able to import RPW as a Maven Project, and it'll set everything up for you.

Make sure you add all jars in the `/libs` folder to build path (those could not be taken from Maven).
