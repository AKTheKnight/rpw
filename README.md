## FAQ

**Q: RPW opens images in Paint instead of Gimp. How to fix?**

Please see issues #53 and #58.

**Q: How to import an existing pack?**

Either add it to library so you can remix it (library menu), or create a new project (project menu) and select "From existing pack".

## Setting up RPW for development

*If you plan to work on RPW's source code:*

Currently RPW is set up as an IntelliJ IDEA project, but what IDE to use is up to you.

It's a Maven project, so all libraries should be downloaded by the IDE automatically.

**Please send pull requests to the "dev" branch.** Master is for finished stuff waiting for the next release.
