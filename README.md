# ResourcePack Workbench

This project is a standalone application for manupulating Minecraft resource packs.

It's really huge, so if you want to help, you are welcome. Either via pull requests, or you can contact me to gain a "collaborator" access.

## Getting it work with eclipse / netbeans / whatever

* Install some Maven plugin (!important)
* Checkout the repo to some folder

   ```
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/MightyPork/rpw.git
   git pull origin master
   ```

* Import as a Maven project
* Add any jars in the `/libs` folder to build path (those could not be taken from Maven)
