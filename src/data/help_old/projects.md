# Projects in Workbench

To make the tool more versatile, it lets you work on multiple packs at the same time.
Each of your created resource packs is represented as a project.


## Project structure

Each project consists of these elements:

**Title** - which will be later used when exporting the pack<br>
**Icon** - a PNG image displayed in Minecraft together with the title and other details<br>
**Assets** - copied from other packs so you can edit them in the project<br>
**Hierarchy data** - information about where individual files are taken from when exporting<br>


## Operations with projects

Once a project is created, you can change it's folder name, duplicate it using "Save As", change it's icon,
title, and of course - if needed - delete it.


## Title and name

There might be some confusion about those two terms. **Title** is the text displayed in-game, a label describing
your pack. **Name** is a name of the folder in which the project files reside - name of the project, not the pack.
When exporting, title is written into the **pack.mcmeta** file.
