# Library

The library is a storage of imported resource packs. You select a pack for import,
and it is then extracted and copied into a library folder.

In your project, you can use the context menu (right-click) to assign sources
from library to groups and files. For more info, see the topic **Sources**.


## Operations with library

To delete or rename imported packs, you can use the **Manage library** menu option.
An easy-to-use management dialog will appear.
