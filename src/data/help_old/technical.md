# Technical details


## Working directory

ResourcePack Workbench lives in a folder called `.mcRPW`, which is located in the
same place as Minecraft's one, `.minecraft`.

On linux, that would be `~/.mcRPW`, on Windows `%APPDATA%/.mcRPW` and who knows
where on Mac, but either way it's the same place where Minecraft stores it's files.


## Used software

Of course I did not just invent all this fancy stuff you see here. The GUI is
made using **SwingX** and the images are scaled up or down with a library called
**Thumbnailator**. Other used libraries are **GSON** and **MarkDown4j**.

The built-in text editors are based on an amazing highlighter component called *RSyntaxTextArea*.

**For full info about licenses involved, read README.txt inside this JAR.**


## Licence & Sharing

I do not care if you share this tool anywhere, as long as it's not altered and
the "About" page gives me proper credit. I also wouldn't like if you took it
and claimed it to be your work. That's not cool.

I'd, however, most appreciate if you shared only a link to the official threads, or at least
this link to the latest version:
