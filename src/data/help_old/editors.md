# File editors

This tool was built on Linux, so it quite obviously isn't configured for Windows or Mac by default.
However, it's fairly easy to fix this.

## Configuring editors

Go to **Optionsâ†’Configure editors**, and a dialog with paths to editor executables will appear.
For each editor, click at the "open" button and locate the EXE file you want to use - GIMP, Notepad,
PS-Pad, Paint.NET, Audacity or about anything else.

On other systems, such as Linux or Mac, you can simply enter the command, eg. **gimp**, and it will
work just fine. The **/usr/bin** path isn't necessary, as it will be used anyway.
