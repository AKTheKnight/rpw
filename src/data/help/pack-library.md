# Resource pack library

Library is a place where RPW keeps imported resource packs. Technically, it's a 
folder in RPW's working directory, where their archives are unpacked.

Packs in library can be used for **remixing**, you can select to use files from 
a pack by right-clicking on a group or file in the main asset tree.


## Managing library

All commands to work with library are located in the `Library` menu.

Apart from working with library packs, there is also a command to re-extract MC 
assets, which you can use after you install some mods into your mods folder, or 
update the game, and want to see those changes in RPW.
