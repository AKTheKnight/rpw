<h1>File editors</h1>

<p>
This tool was built on Linux, so it quite obviously isn't configured for Windows or Mac by default.
However, it's fairly easy to fix this.
</p>

<h2>Configuring editors</h2>
<p>
Go to <b>Optionsâ†’Configure editors</b>, and a dialog with paths to editor executables will appear.
For each editor, click at the "open" button and locate the EXE file you want to use - GIMP, Notepad,
PS-Pad, Paint.NET, Audacity or about anything else.
</p>

<p>
On other systems, such as Linux or Mac, you can simply enter the command, eg. <b>gimp</b>, and it will
work just fine. The <b>/usr/bin</b> path isn't necessary, as it will be used anyway.
