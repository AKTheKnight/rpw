<h1>Resource Packs</h1>

<p>
Resource packs are the modern replacement of texture packs. Unlike texture packs, they
can contain also sounds and text files, which makes them a lot more universal.
</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>
A resource pack consists of some (not necessarily all) asset files, which replace those in the Vanilla pack.
Files that aren't provided by a resource pack are simply taken from Vanilla, so it's easy to change just a
small part of the game and leave the rest unaltered.
</p>

<p>
A resource pack typically contains a folder "assets" with the changed asset files, icon file "pack.png",
and a file with metadata called "pack.mcmeta".
</p>

<h2>Combining packs</h2>

<p>
Resource packs can be modified by simply replacing some files in the zip archive with those from another pack,
resulting in a "remix" pack. That is one of the things this tool will help you with.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that can be done is to add sound files from an audio pack to textures from another pack in order
to modify both aspects of the game. You could also edit some textures from a pack to your liking and use them instead
of those provided by the pack author. All that is very easy with ResourcePack Workbench.
