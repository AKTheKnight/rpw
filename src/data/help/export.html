<h1>Exporting your project</h1>

<p>
When your project is finished or you just want to try it in-game, use the <b>Export</b> menu option.
You will be asked to select the destination file, and the rest of the task will be done for you.
</p>

<p>
In the export, all non-vanilla assets will be included, together with <b>pack.png</b> and a metadata
file <b>pack.mcmeta</b>. If you later decide to change the icon, nothing is easier than just replace
it in the ZIP, or change it in project and export it again.
</p>

<h2>Included Extra Files</h2>
<p>
RPW (since v.3.5) lets you add extra files to the include path. In the project directory, a folder
<b>"included_files"</b> is created, containing (by default) the folders <b>assets/minecraft</b> for convenience.
</p>

<p>
<b>Everything</b> in this folder will be packed into the output ZIP, which means you can add new sound files,
textures for "CTM" in OptiFine, perhaps some mod files and a whole lot of other stuff.
</p>

<h3>Overwriting project files</h3>
<p>If both project configuration and "included_files" provide the same file, it is taken from the
"included_files" folder. This way, you can easily overwrite individual files.
</p>

<p>
If the "included_files" folder contains the same file that is already taken from the project configuration, 
it's possible that you will get a corrupt zip, or that the export will fail. It's easy to avoid this: <b>Don't do it!</b>
</p>



<h2>Types of export</h2>

<p>
You have two options for export: (1) Export to a folder of your choice, or (2) Export directly to
Minecraft's <b>resourcepacks</b> folder. The later option will also modify Minecraft settings to use
this pack next time you start it.
</p>

<h2>Exporting a complete pack</h2>
<p>
In case you want to export a <b>complete pack</b> (usually not needed), that is, include ALL the files,
even those you didn't change at all, then the best option is to click at project's root node and select
<b>Copy to project</b>. All the vanilla files will be copied to your project, resulting in a complete pack.
