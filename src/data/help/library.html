<h1>Library</h1>

The library is a storage of imported resource packs. You select a pack for import,
and it is then extracted and copied into a library folder.

<p>
In your project, you can use the context menu (right-click) to assign sources
from library to groups and files. For more info, see the topic <b>Sources</b>.
</p>
<h2>Operations with library</h2>
