<h1>Projects in Workbench</h1>

<p>
To make the tool more versatile, it lets you work on multiple packs at the same time.
Each of your created resource packs is represented as a project.
</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>
<p>Each project consists of these elements:</p>

<p>
<b>Title</b> - which will be later used when exporting the pack<br>
<b>Icon</b> - a PNG image displayed in Minecraft together with the title and other details<br>
<b>Assets</b> - copied from other packs so you can edit them in the project<br>
<b>Hierarchy data</b> - information about where individual files are taken from when exporting<br>
</p>


<h2>Operations with projects</h2>
<p>
Once a project is created, you can change it's folder name, duplicate it using "Save As", change it's icon,
title, and of course - if needed - delete it.
</p>

<h2>Title and name</h2>
<p>
There might be some confusion about those two terms. <b>Title</b> is the text displayed in-game, a label describing
your pack. <b>Name</b> is a name of the folder in which the project files reside - name of the project, not the pack.
When exporting, title is written into the <b>pack.mcmeta</b> file.
