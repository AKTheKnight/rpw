<h1>"McMeta" files</h1>

<p>
"McMeta" files are metadata files that accompany some texture files in a resource pack.
Those files can define animation speed, frame order, add blur etc.
</p>

<p>
All "McMeta" files use <b>JSON</b> format. Any syntax errors in the format will most likely
cause the "failed texture" (purple-black checkered) to be used instead. Since it's JSON, 
all whitespace (spaces, tabs, line-breaks) outside strings ("string") will be ignored,
so you can format the files as you want.
</p>


<h2>McMeta sections</h2>
<p>
The JSON object consists of several sections, keys. Since you will be using it to alter
textures, we'll focus on those.
</p>

<h3>Animation</h2> 
<p>
The section "animation" can be used only for blocks and items.
</p>

<pre>
{
  "animation": {}
}
</pre>

<p>
If left empty ("{}"), the default timing and frame order will be used, but there's no way
to tell what exactly that will be.
</p>

<p>
The "animation" section can contain two tags:
</p>

<h4>"frametime"</h4>

<p>
 - number of ticks per frame (20 ticks = 1s)<br>
 - when omitted, default timing is used.
</p>

<pre>
{
  "animation": {
    "frametime": 2
  }
}
</pre>

<h4>"frames"</h4>

<p>
 - list of frame numbers to loop<br>
 - when omitted, default frameset is used
</p>

<pre>
{
  "animation": {
    "frames": [
      0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    ]
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
To define duration of individual frames, you'd use this syntax instead of frame number:
</p>

<pre>
{ "index" : 2, "time" : 40 }
</pre>

<p>
...like this:
</p>

<pre>
{
  "animation": {
    "frames": [
      0,
      1,
      { "index" : 2, "time" : 40 },
      3,
      4,
      5
    ]
  }
}
</pre>


<h3>Texture</h2> 
<p>
The section "texture" works only for some textures, such as pumpkin and under-water screen overlays.
</p>

<pre>
{
  "texture": {}
}
</pre>

<p>
There are two possible <b>boolean</b> options for "texture":
</p>

<pre>
{
  "texture": {
    "blur": true,
    "clamp": false
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Blur makes the texture blurred, and clamp is used to prevent texture tiling. There isn't much you can do
with "texture", as you can see.
</p>
