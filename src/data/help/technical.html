<h1>Technical details</h1>

<h2>Working directory</h2>

<p>
ResourcePack Workbench lives in a folder called ".mcRPW", which is located in the
same place as Minecraft's one, ".minecraft". On linux, that would be <b>"~/.mcRPW"</b>,
on Windows <b>"%APPDATA%/.mcRPW"</b> and who knows where on Mac, but either way it's the
same place where Minecraft stores it's files.
</p>

<h2>Used software</h2>
<p>
Of course I did not just invent all this fancy stuff you see here. The GUI is
made using <b>SwingX</b> and the images are scaled up or down with a library called
<b>Thumbnailator</b>.
</p>

<p>
The built-in text editors are based on an amazing highlighter component called RSyntaxTextArea.

<p><b>For full info about licenses involved, read README.txt inside this JAR.</b></p>

<h2>Licence & Sharing</h2>
<p>
I do not care if you share this tool anywhere, as long as it's not altered and
the "About" page gives me proper credit. I also wouldn't like if you took it
and claimed it to be your work. That's not cool.
</p>

<p>
I'd, however, most appreciate if you shared only a link to the official threads, or at least
this link to the latest version:
